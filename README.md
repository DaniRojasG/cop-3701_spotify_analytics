The goal of this project is to use SQL to analyze an online database regarding publically available
Spotify Analytics.

## Data Sources
My data source is the kaggle hub CSV data that will be converted into a local database using
SQLite.

Anybody who wishes to find connections among the raw data of music artists that can lead to new findings
and conclusions that enable us to improve music for everyone.

## Domain
SQLite will be the main tool in this, converting the CSV File of data into a local database
then prompting the database with various SQL Queries and proving connections among the data.
